        <h1> Computer Networks and AI in Networking</h1>
        
        <h4>Hey there, future tech explorer! 🚀 Did you know that computers, phones, and even smart devices are all connected to something called a network? And guess what? Some of these networks even use artificial intelligence (AI) to make them smarter! 
          Let's explore how these cool systems work in a way that's fun and easy to understand. Ready? Let's go!</h4>

        <img src="networking2.jpeg" class="img2" alt="networking1">
          <h2> ✎ What is a Network?</h2> 
        <p>A computer network is like a group of friends chatting with each other! 🎉 Imagine you and your friends all have phones, and you send messages or play games together. A network is just a way for
           computers to connect and share information, just like how you share messages with your friends.</p>
        <h2 class="whats"> <h2>✎ What’s AI in Networking?</h2>
        
        <p>Artificial Intelligence is like the brain of a computer network! AI helps networks get better at managing data, protecting against hackers, and making sure everything runs smoothly. It’s like having a super-smart helper inside the network that keeps things safe and efficient. 🤖</p>
        
      <h2>→Types of Networks – LAN, WAN, MAN, PAN←</h2>
      <h3>____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________-</h3>
      <h1>LAN</h1>
      <p><strong>A LAN is a network that connects computers within a small area like a home, school, or office. It’s like a little “neighborhood” where all the devices
         can share information quickly.</strong></p>

      </a></p>
    <h1>WAN</h1>
    <p><strong>A WAN is a much bigger network that connects computers over large distances, like across cities or even countries. The Internet is the biggest example of a WAN, connecting millions 
      of devices all over the world.</strong></p>

    </a></p>
  <h1>PAN</h1>
  <p><strong>A PAN is a small network designed for personal devices, usually within a very
     short range (like a room or a pocket).</strong></p>

  </a></p>
  
      <h1>MAN</h1>
      <p><strong>A MAN connects devices in a city or large campus. It's bigger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN.

      <h2>Network Components & Devices – Routers, Switches, Servers, etc.</h2>
      <h3>Now, let’s talk about the different gadgets and tools that help make networks work smoothly!</h3>
      <img src="Wireless icon.jpeg" width="300" height="200" style="display: block; margin: auto;">
      <h1>1.Router</h1>
      
      <p>A router is like a traffic cop for the internet! 🚦 It directs data from your home network to the internet and vice versa. If you’re browsing the web or watching videos, it’s the router that helps your 
        computer talk to websites across the globe.</p>
      
      <img src="NETGEAR 8 Port Gigabit Ethernet Unmanaged.jpeg" width="300" height="200" style="display: block; margin: auto;" >
        <h1>2.Switch</h1>
      <p>A switch is a device that connects multiple computers in a local area network (LAN). It helps devices communicate with each other within the same network. It’s like a mail sorter 
        for the devices in your house or school.</p>
      
      <img src="06d0e663ed80fde0e10dc0173696f030.jpg" width="300" height="200" style="display: block; margin: auto;">
        <h1>3. Server</h1>
      <p>A server is a powerful computer that provides services to other computers in the network. Servers store things like websites, files, or even game data.

        Example: When you visit a website, the server is where the website 
        “lives” and sends the content to your device!</p>
      
        <img src="9da3b98846dd1b925eadde5e40ef8549.jpg" width="300" height="200" style="display: block; margin: auto;">
        <h1>4. Modem</h1>
        <p>A modem is a device that connects your home network to the internet. It’s like the bridge between your local network 
          (LAN) and the wider world of the internet.</p>

          <h3>_______________________________________________________________________•❃°•°❀°•°❃•___________________________________________________________________________-</h3>
      <h2>The Internet & AI in Networking</h2>
      <h4>How Does the Internet Work?</h4>
      <p>The internet is a giant network of networks that connects millions of computers, servers, and devices all over the world. When you type a website address in your browser, your computer sends a request over the internet to a server that hosts the website. The server sends the website back to your computer, and voilà, you can see it!</p>
      <h4>AI in Networking – Making Things Smarter</h4>
      <p>Did you know that AI (Artificial Intelligence) is making networks smarter and more efficient? Let’s 
        look at some cool ways AI is used in networking:</p>
      <h4>1. AI-driven Cybersecurity</h4>
      <p>AI helps protect networks from hackers and viruses! It can quickly detect unusual activity in the network and block cyberattacks before they cause harm. AI is like a super detective, always on the lookout for anything suspicious. 🕵️‍♂️</p>
      <h4>2. Traffic Management</h4>
      <p>AI can help manage how data moves through a network. It can make sure data flows smoothly without any traffic jams, just like a traffic light controlling cars in a busy city. 🚗🚦</p>
      <h4>3. Predictive Maintenance</h4>
      <p>AI can also predict when a network device, like a router or server, might break down and alert the network manager before something goes wrong. It's like having a crystal ball for technology! 🔮</p>
